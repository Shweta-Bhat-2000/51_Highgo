  <div class="points">
    <h3>1. As per the guidelines of the Central Government of India, any orphan, abandoned or surrendered child, declared legally free for adoption by the child welfare committee is eligible for adoption.</h3>
    <h3>2. A child is said to be an orphan when the child is without a legal parent or a guardian or the parents are not capable of taking care of the child anymore.</h3>
    <h3>3. A child is considered abandoned on being deserted or unaccompanied by parents or a guardian and the child welfare committee has declared the child to be abandoned.</h3>
    <h3>4. A surrendered child is one who has been relinquished on account of physical, social and emotional factors which are beyond the control of parents or the guardian and is so declared by the child welfare committee.</h3>
    <h3>5. In order to be adopted, a child needs to be “legally free”. On receipt of an abandoned child, the District Child Protection Unit puts up an alert with the child’s photograph and details in state-wide newspapers and request the local police to trace the parents. The child is considered legally free for adoption only after the police has given a report stating that the parents of the child are non-traceable.</h3>

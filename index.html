      <h1><strong>GUIDELINES</strong></h1>
    </div>
    <div class="rules">
      <h2><strong>Rules and Regulation</strong></h2>
        <h4 id="points">1. In order to adopt a child, the adoptive parents must be physically, mentally and financially stable. The accumulative age of the parents should be under 110. A single adoptive parent must be under 55 years of age to adopt a child in India. The minimum age of either parent should be over 25 years</h4>
        <h4 id="points">2. Marital status of the parents is not a factor. However, the couple should be married for at least two years. Besides, under the new provisions of the Adoption Act, no single male in India can adopt a girl child</h4>
        <h4 id="points">3. In India, a child has to be free of legal custody before being adopted. In case of any abandoned child, the District Child Protection Unit has to circulate the details and a photograph of that child in a state-level newspaper</h4>
        <h4 id="points">4. No abandoned child can be adopted without the police clearance of non-traceability of the child's original parents</h4>

   <br>
   <div class="laws">
     <h2><strong>Government Laws</strong></h2>
     <h4 id="points">1. Adoption law in India is in conjunction with the personal laws of individual religion and therefore, adoption is not allowed as per the personal laws of Muslims, Christians, Parsis and Jews in the country. However, an adoption can be made from an orphanage under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, subject to court’s approval. In this case, the adoptive couple are guardians and not parents of the adopted child. Under this Act, Christians can adopt a child only under foster care and the foster child is free to break away all relations from the guardians on becoming a major.</h4>
     <h4 id="points">2. Indian citizens who are Hindus, Jains, Buddhists or Sikhs are allowed to adopt a child formally and the adoption is as per the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 which was enacted as part of the Hindu code bills.</h4>
     <h4 id="points">3. Adoption of abandoned, surrendered or abused children is governed by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.</h4>
     <h4 id="points">4. Currently, there is no specific law that governs adoption of kids in India by foreign nationals or NRI’s but the same is governed under Guidelines Governing Adoption of Children, 2015. In the absence of any concrete Act for intercountry adoption, the procedures laid down by the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 are followed.</h4>
